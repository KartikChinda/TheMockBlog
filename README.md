Fire up the app here: https://the-mock-blog.vercel.app/


Want to work on the app locally? No worries. 
Here's how you do it: 
## Getting Started

# Next.js App

Welcome to the **Next.js App**! This project is a starter template to get you up and running quickly with Next.js.

## Table of Contents

- [Clone the Repository](#clone-the-repository)
- [Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies)
- [Run the Development Server](#run-the-development-server)
---

## Fork the Repository

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Fork** button at the top right to create your own fork of the repository.

## Clone the Repository

Once you've forked the repository, you'll need to clone it to your local machine.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command, replacing `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/TheMockBlog.git
    ```

3. Open the cloned repository in an IDE of your choice.

## Install Dependencies

In the project directory, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run The Development Server 
 
Voila, you're all done! In an integrated terminal, all you need to run now is 
```bash
npm run dev
```

And an instance of the app should spin up on localhost:3000 (if Port 3000 is busy for you, it might show up on 3001, just take a look at what port gets spun up in the terminal.)
